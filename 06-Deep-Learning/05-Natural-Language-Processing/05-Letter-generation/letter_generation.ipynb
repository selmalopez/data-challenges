Depending on your computer, there are chances that a too large number of sentences will make your compute slow down, or even freeze - your RAM can even overflow. For that reason, you can start with 20% of the sentences and see if your computer handles it. Otherwise, rerun with a lower number. On the other hand, you can increase the number if you feel like it. \n",

as a co producer the cinematographer not that it makes much difference i'd have though that nowicki would have been more than happy for matthews to take the 'credit' for making this piece of crap no one involved in the making of the nostril picker should be allowed to go anywhere near a camera again ever the nostril picker is easily one of the worst films i've ever seen that's saying something it's absolutely terrible in every possible way imaginable the script by steven hodge is atrocious there's no narrative structure excitement tension drama character development the things that do happen are so mind numbingly dumb it's untrue the plot devices chain of events in the nostril picker are totally incomprehensible the scene where joe finds out the prostitute steven andrews he hired is in fact a man joe starts to chase him around his apartment with two squirting dildo's is simply jaw dropping stuff the subsequent scene when the transvestite reports the incident to the police is hilariously written had me psychically laughing at the dialogue i hated the ending as well not only was it predictable but it leaves the door open for a sequel i psychically shudder at the mere thought on a technical level the nostril picker is awful point hope photography bland inappropriate music forgettable locations poorly edited brenda is killed in the kitchen yet her blood splashes on the t v screen that was clearly in the opposite room some of the worst acting i've sat through very unimpressive special effects which consist of a few cut off rubber fingers a slit throat a quick scene where joe eats some flesh it comes as no surprise that the cast crew who worked on the nostril picker have virtually no imdb credits for anything before or after even at 76 odd minutes the nostril picker is far to long really boring to sit through i could go on on all day long about how bad the nostril picker is i really could one thing i can't quite work out is was all this intentional by the filmmakers the nostril picker is indeed a unique film unique in it's awfulness incompetence in the the case of the nostril picker i hope it remains unique too having said that it's still not the worst film i've ever seen but it comes close that's for sure definitely one to avoid\",\n",

boy everyone else was laughing but they weren't within constant eyesight br br let's get it out of the way the peter jackson 'lord of the rings' films do owe something to the bakshi film in jackson's version of the fellowship of the ring for instance the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshi's film shot by shot you could call this plagiarism or homage depending on your agenda br br i'm sure the similarities don't stop there i'm not going to do any research to find out what they are because that would imply i have some mote of respect for this film i'm sure others have outlined the similarities look around br br this movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor and many many people died in the accident i've decided to list what i can remember in a more or less chronological fashion if i've left out anything else that offended me it's because i'm completely overwhelmed confronted with a wealth of failure and at high points mediocrity br br due to heavy use of rotoscoping gandalf is no longer a gentle wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film br br saruman the white is sometimes referred to as 'aruman' during the film without explanation he wears purple and red for some mysterious reason br br sam is flat out hideous the portrayal of his friendship with frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying yes hobbits are small like children but they are not children br br merry and pippin are never introduced they simply appear during a scene change with a one sentence explanation the film is filled with sloppy editing like this br br frodo sam pippin and merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road one of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his back which was not visible before and begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into la la la s awful br br aragorn apparently is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic no pants complete with huge square pilgrim belt buckle he is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie oftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass br br the black riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace this is disturbing to be sure but not frightening br br the scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of bruinen in which they stare at frodo who is on the other side on horseback goes on forever during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and do nothing else the scene was probably intended to illustrate frodo's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound it turns out to be more plodding than anything else br br gimli the dwarf is just as tall as legolas the elf he's a dwarf there is simply no excuse for that he also looks like a bastardized david the gnome it's a crude but accurate description br br boromir appears to have pilfered elmer fudd's golden viking armor from that bugs bunny opera episode he looks ridiculous br br despite the similarity to tolkien's illustration the balrog is howl inducing and the least threatening villain in the entire film it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers and it's barely taller than gandalf purists may prefer this balrog but i'll take jackson's version any day br br the battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments i'm not asking for action packed scenes like those in jackson's film but they are supposed to be fighting br br treebeard makes a very short appearance and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all watch the film you'll see what i mean br br alright now for the good parts of the film br br some of the voice acting is pretty good it isn't that aragorn sounds bad he just looks kind of like the jolly green giant br br galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal like tom bombadil she seems immune to the ring's powers of temptation and her voice actress isn't horrible either br br boromir's death isn't as heart wrenching as in jackson's portrayal of the same scene but it's still appropriately dramatic and more true to his death in the book though i don't believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did br br as my professor pointed out between whispered threats the orcs mainly at helm's deep if i'm correct resemble the war ravaged corpses of soldiers a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what's being attempted br br while this isn't really a positive point about the film bakshi can't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie or so i've been told the project was on a tight budget and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher ups who i'm sure hadn't read the books br br let me be clear i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product br br overall i cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughs unless you've already read the books and have your own

people i walk alongside it is the perfect day to stop off for croissants and a café o lait before heading off to the city of lights and love of course a flight to paris is not reasonably in this humble film critic's budget so i had to opt for the next best thing paris je t'aime a collection of 18 short films by a variety of international directors each piece is named after a different parisian neighborhood and is a reflection on love careful not to over glorify the most powerful and persuasive of all human emotions paris je t'aime explores love at the many stages of its own game the results are spontaneously romantic and surprisingly consistent and truly what better way to express the fleeting nature of love and how a moment can change your life than with a collection of filmed moments br br the beautifully poetic quote above is taken from tom tykwer's faubourg saint denis true to form tykwer run lola run uses time lapse photography and repetition to demonstrate the entire cycle of love from inception to dissolution originally shot in 2004 and paired down for this anthology faubourg stars natalie portman as francine an american actress in paris for a part in a film and melchior beslon as thomas a blind man she falls in love with here the blind leads the blind through the most unstable of terrain where two people consume each other to a point where their lives nearly lose their own existences as love seems to go from dazzling to dizzying tykwer reminds us of the tricks it can play on our minds and the illusions it can create when we stray towards doubt br br perhaps the most giddily romantic offering comes from sylvain chomet's tour eiffel choosing the city's most identifiable attraction for its title chomet les triplettes de belleville gives us a little boy who tells the story of how his parents met and fell in love his father a mime paul putner finds himself falling into one surreal scenario after another and eventually lands himself in jail this is where he meets the woman who will become the love of his life yolande moreau miming has become something of a dying art if it isn't already dead yet by nature it is dreamy and untroubled

could just take ourselves a little less seriously br br paris je t'aime keeps the flow lively by not always focusing on love between lovers three memorable shorts focus on the love between a parent and a child walter salles motorcycle diaries has catalina sandino moreno singing lovingly to her child before she leaves him to sing the same song with a distant longing to the child she watches over for her living nobuhiro suwa un couple parfait has juliette binoche trying desperately to overcome the emptiness she feels after losing her son binoche says very little yet not surprisingly given her immense talent her struggle is evident in her face as she learns that love sometimes means letting go and alfonso cuaron children of men weighs in with one continuous shot of a father nick nolte and his grown daughter sara martins walking together for what must be the first time in a long while we see them only from across the street and we only get close to them as the distance between the two characters narrows to a place of comfort and accepting br br the last short to screen is alexander payne's 14ieme arrondissement as usual payne sideways takes an ordinary person and shows us what makes them extraordinary carol margo martindale is another american in paris she is there alone and for less time than she would have liked as she has dogs waiting for her at home she is a plain person with an uneventful life who finds herself in a city that is rich and lush in beautifully delivered americanized french she muses about the sights and how being there makes her feel this woman spends so much time trying to be happy despite life's numerous disappointments and as she sits in a city made for lovers she realizes that she is in fact happy and loves herself more than she knew she falls in love if only for perhaps a moment with life and love itself br br the characters that appear but fleetingly in paris je t'aime find themselves at the romantic center of the universe the moments they share with each other be it helping someone up after a hard fall or reaching out your hand to another person without touching them or without their knowledge are the moments that give love its flare and flourish outside the city of lovers it can be easy to miss moments such as these but we must remind ourselves of their significance it takes but a moment for love to shine through a cloudy sky you just have to keep your heart open to see it and if one city can be so abundant with love one has to believe it can find its way one day to your door\",\n",

pilot and his daughter after a robbery netting millions a para military bunch is double crossed by one of their own a very nervous guy named burt he jumps out of the plane with the big and heavy box that holds the money with apparently no plans as to how to move it around once he is on the ground being the dumbest of the bunch he is murdered first but not before he happens upon the fowler residence nestled snuggly amid lots of really creepy looking scarecrows and surrounded with a wooden fence encircled with barbed wire and lots of warnings to stay away and the weird weathervane on the roof with the pitchfork and pterodactyl should have been a warning sign too the inside of the house is also quite foreboding to us in the audience anyway br br annoyingly we must listen to burt's thoughts in voice over as he walks around and mysteriously comes across the key to the decrepit truck in the yard the way the key pops up would be enough to have my pants with me in them flying out the door perhaps it's just me but i really enjoy watching people's lips move on screen even when they are just thinking out loud it helps to intensify the action and gives the actor more to do than just look like what the voice over is saying burt hoists the box onto the truck and makes his getaway sure why not decrepit trucks always have lots of gas in them especially with today's prices and the battery no problem now i did mention that burt was the dumbest of the bunch and here is why in addition to the above of course wearing night vision goggles to walk through the foliage and find the house he takes them off to drive the truck away and instead turns on the headlights to see where he is going of course the crooks still in the plane spot the headlights of his truck and know where he is headed brilliant he deserves to die definitely i am not sure why he needed night vision goggles in the first place as every scene is brightly lit from the interior of the plane to the night time outside scenery and the house the cinematographer was either a myopic b just out of school or c dealing with really cheap filmstock br br burt meets his demise when the truck dies in the middle of nowhere go figure one very nice touch and there are i must admit a few in the film is the fact that when he opens the truck's lid there is no engine creepy to be sure and insert pants comment again here the story logic fails when dead now stuffed like a flounder with money and straw burt returns to the house the rest of the bunch are there rough him up then realize that he is indeed dead and was gutted and stuffed like a flounder with money and straw dead burt does manage to put up quite a fight though and grabs one fellow by the mouth pushing him through a window causing him to bite off more than he could chew in a gorylicious scene at this point you would think they'd would be racing out of the house and back to the plane but noooo they decide to stay and look for the rest of the money in fact the whole burt is dead episode is treated rather matter of factly although one bright bulb in the bunch does argue burt was walking around dead for chrissakes br br the stolen money suddenly appears on the grounds outside the house and the crooks blithely go for the bait soon another one of them jack is dispatched and again the scene is well done and horrific involving a dull handsaw and no anethesia now there are three scarecrows going about wreaking mayhem and one of them needs a hand literally br br when one of the crooks sees the scarecrows and jack getting scarecrow ized he starts screaming running away like hell and shooting off his gun in typical para military fashion so much for all that training under pressure crap he meets up with the others and stops in his tracks to explain why he is screaming running away like hell and shooting off his gun even though the scarecrows appear to be chasing him again that script logic thing dead and gutted jack returns to the house and goes after the screamer with the usual results if you listen to jack's demonic growl by the way you may notice depending on your age that it is the same monster growling sound heard often in the lost in space tv episodes br br the last two survivors race away from the house and back to the plane barely escaping but do they you will have to see the film to find out\",\n",

       " \"love hurts that i think is the main message mike binder's newest film reign over me brings across whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world love hurts the great thing about this film however is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can't free themselves from alone there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 9 11 effected us all ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret br br this is a new career performance for adam sandler i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish pent up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor but also can be used to show a repressed man shy and shutout to the world around him\\x97a man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punch drunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on 9 11 that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result he became reclusive and started to believe he couldn't remember anything that happened before that day he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him those that love him try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family he goes through life with his ipod and headphones shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember br br reign over me is not about charlie fineman though it is about dentist and family man alan johnson a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life he has no friends and when he sees charlie by chance one day his life evolves into something he hasn't felt in 15 years he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family cheadle's character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandler's doesn't mind because all that was before he met his wife the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives once they begin opening up though it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the façade they have created for themselves br br the supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads jada pinkett smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting perfect casting the many small cameos are also effective even writer director mike binder's role as sandler's old best friend and accountant my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere considering it is his film last but not least is the beautiful saffron burrows she is a great actress and plays the love crushed divorcée trying to put her life back together wonderfully a role that seems comic relief at first but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come br br binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time the direction is almost flawless the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore background really annoyed me in the beginning the acting superb and the story true to itself never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion even the music was fantastic and used to enhance not to lead us emotionally why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end i don't know but it did unfortunately stick out for me reign over me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope\",\n",

february 1943 the details are given in an addendum that follows this review br br the film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in new york city in the present here a well off non observant jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual she goes even further demanding that her daughter's non jewish fiancé leave the house br br the distressed daughter hannah maria schrader then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during wwii in berlin her mother then 8 years old had been taken in and protected by an aryan woman hannah drops everything goes to berlin and finds this woman lena fischer now 90 hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story it all seems rather too pat br br the film thereafter improves focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest in which the fictitious central character is the same mrs fischer at 33 played magnificently by katja riemann a baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to fabian martin feifel a jewish concert violinist one of the men detained at the rosenstrasse site br br the narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in new york city once again while scenes in the present are color saturated the 1943 scenes are washed out strong on blue gray tones br br the quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in germany and the direction of margarethe von trotta new german cinema's most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress br br the story of the protest is told simply only one feature is lacking that would have helped still text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positive br br rosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music so go the usual raps it is too long but i found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on rosenstrasse where their jewish relatives and others were detained i found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction br br the very absence of extreme violence no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed you keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute the somberness of the film stayed with me afterward i awoke often later in the night i saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film for me that happens rarely in german and english my rating 8 10 b seen on 05 31 05 if you'd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites br br add the rosenstrasse protest swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the final roundup in the national capital 1700 to 2000 jews mostly men married to non jewish women were herded into rosenstrasse 2 4 a welfare office for the jewish community in central berlin br br because these jews had german relatives many of them highly connected adolf eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied poland br br normally those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the east but before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the rosenstrasse address first in ones and twos and then in ever growing numbers br br perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest although not all at the same time women demanded back their husbands day after day for a week unarmed unorganized and leaderless they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the third reich br br joseph goebbels the gauleiter governor or district leader of berlin anxious to have that city racially cleansed was also in charge of the nation's public morale on both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women's actions rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the final solution goebbels with hitler's concurrence released the rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty five of them who already had been sent to auschwitz br br to both hitler and goebbels the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable but they were mistaken almost all of those released from rosenstrasse survived the war the women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction adapted from an article posted at the university of south florida website a teacher's guide to the holocaust\",\n",

       " \"it is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film whereas patton lust for glory' producer frank mccarthy's earlier biography of a controversial american general from the second world war has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments like a previous reviewer i am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other br br one difference between the two films is that patton' is more focused concentrating on a relatively short period at and immediately after the end of the second world war whereas macarthur' covers not only this war but also its subject's role in the korean war as well as his period as american governor of occupied japan during the interlude br br the main difference however lies in the way the two leaders are played gregory peck dominates this film even more than george c scott dominated patton' whereas scott had another major star karl malden playing opposite him as general bradley none of the other actors in macarthur' are household names at least for their film work scott of course portrayed patton as aggressive and fiery tempered a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race not just with the enemy i suspect that in real life general macarthur was as volcanic an individual as patton but that is not how he appears in this film peck's macarthur is of a more reflective thoughtful bent comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films at times he even seems to be a man of the political left much of his speech on the occasion of the japanese surrender in 1945 could have been written by a paid up member of cnd and his policies for reforming japanese society during the american occupation have a semi socialist air to them in an attempt to show something of macarthur's gift for inspiring leadership peck makes him a fine speaker but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart it is as if atticus finch from to kill a mockingbird' had put on a general's uniform br br whereas scott attempted a warts and all' portrait of patton the criticism has been made that macarthur' attempts to gloss over some of its subject's less attractive qualities i think that this criticism is a fair one particularly as far as the korean war is concerned the film gives the impression that macarthur was a brilliant general who dared stand up to interfering militarily ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was sacked for his pains when victory was within his grasp many historians of course feel that truman was forced to sack macarthur because the latter's conduct was becoming a risk to world peace and had no choice but to accept a stalemate because stalin would not have allowed his chinese allies to be humiliated even during the korean scenes peck's macarthur comes across as more idealistic than his real life original probably was we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters truman 's remark he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about sunday' was said about eisenhower but it could equally well have been applied to macarthur's approach to international diplomacy perhaps the film's attempt to paint out some of macarthur's warts reflects the period in which it was made the late seventies after the twin traumas of vietnam and watergate was a difficult time for america and a public looking for reassurance might have welcomed a reassuringly heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation another criticism i would make of the film is that it falls between two stools if it was intended to be a full biography of macarthur something should have been shown of his early life which is not covered at all the first we see of the general is when he is leading the american resistance to the japanese invasion of the philippines one theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of general macarthur's father himself a military hero i would have liked to see what sort of man arthur macarthur was and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on korea and on macarthur's clash with truman with equal prominence given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches br br it would be wrong however to give the impression that i disliked the film altogether although i may not have agreed with peck's interpretation of the main role there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness the film as a whole is a good example of a solid workmanlike biopic thoughtful and informative it is a good film but one that could have been a better one 7 10 br br on a pedantic note the map which macarthur is shown using during the korean war shows the dmz the boundary between the two korean states that did not come into existence until after the war the pre war boundary was the 38th parallel also i think that macarthur was referring to the tocsin' of war war may be toxic but it is difficult to listen with thirsty ear for a toxin\",\n",

the much underused sphinx wes studi who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over wise br br this film really is a cross genre romp anyone wanting to pigeon hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle this is a spoof parody of the superhero genre from the pseudo burton sets recycled endlessly and occasionally decorated with more spoof material to the ridiculous costumes the comic book genre gets a pretty good send up but at the same time it is a serious superhero flick as well both at once while not a necessarily unique idea in itself for example this movie is in some ways reflective of d c comic's short lived inferior five work it is fairly innovative for the big screen it offers the comic book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway then throws in the inevitable wanna bes and we all know if superheroes were real so would these guys be real if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city you'd see a half dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis sure the shoveller fights pretty well and the blue raja hurls forks with great accuracy all parts of the super hero world but does that make them genuine super heroes only in their minds br br this movie is also a comedy albeit a dark one inevitable when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super heroics one liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of particularly marvelous is the dialogue by janeane garofalo with her bowling ball father yet it isn't a comedy in the sense of side splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes it mixes in a dose of drama of discovery and of romance but never really ventures fully into any of it br br what really makes mystery men a good film in the end is that it is very engaging the weak lame good guys are eventually justified and for one shining moment really become super heroes justice is served and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise if the viewer stops trying to label the film then the film can be a great romp br br of course no movie is perfect claire forlani comes off as bored and directionless as mr furious' love interest in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor dr heller although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone and the villians are never more than gun toting lackeys a point of which is made in the film the cinematography is choppy and disjointed such as happens in the average comic book so it is excusable the music sometimes overpowers the scenery and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well br br yet overall this film is incredible you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest br br 8 10 in my opinion\",\n",

intelligent cinema br br johnny yuma is in most respects not terribly original but this actually does not count against it the success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience's expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements earlier pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle or major twist that provide continuing interest the quality of the execution is also obviously important a tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience br br given these criteria johnny yuma succeeds there are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films the setting is the brutal twisted semi feudal twilight world of shared by many of the best gothic family westerns made 1964 1968 such as tempo di massacre 1966 the plot is a combination of the basic fistful of dollars 1964 plot and the ringo films a fact not surprising as screenwriter fendiando di leo was involved in both di leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of cinecitta in the 1960s 70s and his work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of actors directors and screenwriters in the fod plot the protagonist arrives in town stirs up a tense situation then undergoes a near death followed by a resurrection in some films like quella sporca storia nel west 1968 it is quite literally a crucifixion the catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing especially given the implicit populist explicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films the ringo plot developed more fully by screenwriter ernesto gastaldi in a series of films starring guliano gemma a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over his own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community with a healthy dash ironic uncertainty br br the relationship between carradine and johnny is clearly based on that of manco mortimer from a fistful of dollar 1965 the two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two numerous films including da uomo a uomo 1968 or even el chuncho quién sabe 1967 use this relationship between an older and younger man father son older younger brother anglo adviser adversary and peasant revolutionary as a central dynamic to the plot br br additionally there is the focus on deception and misdirection mazes and mirrors that recur throughout the best early wai the canons and pueblos of almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse br br what distinguishes johnny yuma from other wai is the quality of director romolo guerriri's use of visual psychological space together arrangement with the script's intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot dialogue was never very important to the wai and often absurdly unintelligible thought there are exceptions such as the cynical commentaries in django 1966 or faccia a faccia 1967 br br psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery it's juxtapositions and it's description of the overall narrative situation see how the presence of the deadly samantha is felt during the beating scene \\x96 watching from the roof or from the background of the action or how johnny strips samantha and pedro of their security and confidence in their power through his stealthy invasions of their ranch hotel even bedroom this again is a theme from fod finally note how there is a focus on the search for information like many elements this is borrowed from fod which was ultimately based on the hard boiled mystery novel red harvest it is through incidental contacts wanted posters overheard conversations glances out of windows watches left in the dust or mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of pedro and samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative tacks forward to it's conclusion br br the movie was notable in it's time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence of course these films were hardly more violent than many american westerns what was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed which is to say that it was not the violence but it's meaning that had changed johnny yuma is distinct and interesting in it's use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film br br what i personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous nameless audiences in italy and spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest the artifact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself \\x96 some flint debitage from a prehistoric site a shard of cruse pottery or a moldering piece of leather and

       " \"johnathan frakes is a good actor and when he's not directing a family film a fine director but he really shouldn't have directed this movie and the screenplay should've been rejected the director and writers must understand what the original tv show was really about as well as who the characters were and how they worked the original series had many episodes with razor sharp writing using good dialogue and with situations that american producers would never consider using in children's programming much less a movie which made the original series so well received by adults i mean the tracys were college graduates and some of them did even drank alcohol and smoked tobacco and there were characters who did get killed although most were bad guys if they had written it the way that it was originally done which isn't dumbing things down with poor dialogue kindergarten humor and a weak plot this universal studio canal joint venture wouldn't have such bad reviews br br this motion picture is almost pure blasphemy if you've seen the original supermarionation series then you'll know what i'm talking about br br the first thing that was out of place and annoying were the constant references to ford motor company even going so far that lady penelope was riding around in a disfigured ford thunderbird made up to look like fab 1 instead of using what would've been more appropriate considering ms penelope's station not to mention being more faithful to the original a rolls royce fab 1 she's supposed to be a distinguished member of british society hence the preference for england's finest make of motorcars in the original series one other reviewer here indicated that penelope wouldn't be caught dead in a ford he's pretty much right in the context that the idea of her riding in a ford doesn't work at least they could have had penelope ride in a jaguar made up like fab 1 since jaguar is a british car make that is owned by ford but no they had to use a straight ford but the ford product placement doesn't end there every single car you may see is a ford even the news flash that is shown on the tv sets in the movie were sponsored by ford ford ford ford the predominance of ford vehicles makes this movie an obvious marketing vehicle for ford br br the original series had a design that was futuristic for the 1960s and still remains ahead of its time even today but the futuristic design in the original series worked because there was an effort to make the design look practical and functional this kind of treatment didn't exist in the movie where everything is stylized to excess defeating the sense of functionality and practicality a lot of things that were done in the design of the movie were done strictly for style many times with no sense of function to give that style a sense of reason br br the original series relied on good acting performances of the voice talent to overcome the limited expressions in the puppets bringing them to life in the episodes the brilliant and lively music score by barry gray helped even further to connect the audience with the story the characters and how everything came together to help achieve the super objective a little bit of stanislavski talk the movie on the other hand had some overly grating performances anthony edwards overplayed brains to a fault bill paxton as jeff tracy just didn't work despite decent acting one of few there were better choices for the hood than ben kingsley and many others that i don't care to mention it would take too long quite simply the puppets were more believable second was the overly generic and underwhelming music score by hans zimmer sounding more like a mix between days of thunder and apollo 13 br br and of course the hood the hood in the original series had an ability to communicate with kyrano through a statue of kyrano as an outlet for esp contact but that was where his extraordinary capability ended he's a master of disguise and deception which allows him to sneak around undetected for the most part anyways to gather information of the thunderbirds vehicles for his own means he also uses weapons for his own defense including pistols and generally collects information using a film camera although he tried to steal thudnerbirds 1 and 2 in the 1960s united artists release of thunderbird 6 which was the last thunderbirds show filmed in supermarionation and was the second thunderbirds theatrical release but while he is a nemesis of international rescue the hood isn't the villain in every thunderbirds episode and he tends to avoid direct confrontation with international rescue in the movie he's obviously the main villain but he and his cohorts seem to act more like morons along with the hood having extended mind control ability including the ability to move objects and move himself into flight for brief periods of time this totally deviates from the hood as a character in the original series with one that may leave kids laughing and people familiar with the series scratching their heads in confusion or leaving the theater in disgust br br there are more criticisms but the 1000 word limit for imdb reviews will not allow me to list all of them so i will close with the point being made that i didn't enjoy this movie as a matter of fact i think it sucks having seen the original series and supermarionation movies thunderbirds are go thunderbird 6 i was hoping for something a lot better than this br br the original supermarionation was a lot more sophisticated and elegant than this live action farce and

to earn best picture in the big show among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well acclaimed play the original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation which comes as a double edged sword on one hand who better to translate the play than the original writer on the other hand who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense with a frustrating ending unnecessary dialogue questionable directing and of course the inability to provide substantial answers it is a growing trend among these high caliber films to not answer all questions it provides and this has to stop br br doubt is like a joke without its punch line like a book with the final 20 pages missing like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next doubt just like the previous best picture frustrationfest no country for old men doesn't really end it doesn't provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending yes that was the intent but this isn't a test of humanity it's a cop out i do not pay money to see an unfinished work i pay money to see a beginning middle and end and pray that i don't fall asleep during the three acts we are forced to become the writers of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other br br this little drama is about a nun meryl streep who seems very sure that the well beloved priest philip seymour hoffman is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church the first african american boy in the catholic church the church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone's backs the plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently which attracts the notice of a young teacher amy adams the story is set right after the assassination of john f kennedy which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other br br doubt's strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over streep seems to be oscar worthy in every role she's in and here she is no different as her sternness and cold hearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church hoffman excels yet again as the priest by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura the seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time but hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers when these two argue you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched but let's not forget amy adams enchanted and viola davis law ad order for their superb job either doubt's casting ensemble is among the best in 2008 br br yet like previously stated it's the writing and directing that ruins this film especially when dwindling down the third act questions pop up but they aren't answered characters pop up but provide no real enhancement towards the plot kids behave different but we never truly find out why there are awkward angles in the camera work\\x85and\\x85there's no actual reason why john patrick shanley the writer of the play had one previous film in his directing repertoire joe versus the volcano whether sheer arrogance or stupidity we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation utter annoying chatter that bores to no end there was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted thanks to mr shanley br br bottom line the lack of an ending is a stupid trend that's just as irritating as the seizureific camera work in action films it doesn't matter that we have a great talented acting cast or decent cinematography or a good story being worked upon or good usage of sound and music because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet doesn't even finish the translation from play to film is good and quite accurate because we have the original madmen behind the project\\x97but he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well this decade has seen its share of blockbuster and high profile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end sideways cast away no country for old men burn after reading are a few examples br br newsflash end your stinkin' movie please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank like wall e's depressing backstories instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness confusion and mental anguish have a beginning middle and the end please as a critic i prefer my films to be whole not incomplete doubt feels incomplete which is why it gets an incompetent grade br br
